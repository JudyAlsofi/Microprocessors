## Project Summary

This project implements a Tomasulo algorithm simulator with JavaFX GUI for the Microprocessors course.

### Features Implemented
- [x] Reservation stations for FP Add/Sub, Mul/Div, and Integer operations
- [x] Load/Store buffers
- [x] Register file with register renaming (tags)
- [x] Direct-mapped data cache with configurable parameters
- [x] Support for all required instruction types (loads, stores, FP ops, integer ops, branches)
- [x] Cycle-by-cycle execution with GUI visualization
- [x] Configurable latencies and cache parameters
- [x] RAW, WAR, WAW hazard handling via register renaming

### Test Cases Validated
- [x] Test Case 1: Sequential code with RAW hazards
- [x] Test Case 2: Sequential code with WAW hazard
- [x] Test Case 3: Loop code with branches

## How to Run

1. Ensure Java 11+ and Maven are installed
2. Open terminal/PowerShell in project directory
3. Run: `mvn javafx:run`
4. Use GUI to load test cases and step through execution

## Known Limitations

- Single issue/writeback per cycle (simplified model)
- Branch instructions parsed but not fully executed (no PC updates)
- Synthetic result values used for demonstration
